# PROJECT-DATA-STRUCTURES-
Creare  C programs that interact with data from the "ocean.csv" file, containing ocean water measurements spanning from 2000 to 2015. 1. Sorting Algorithms: Implement two sorting algorithms, Insertion Sort and Quick Sort, to arrange the data by date while considering temperature values.2. Parameter-Based Sorting Algorithms: Employ Heap Sort and Counting Sort to organize the data by date, this time taking into account phosphate levels. Your focus is on sorting by date while considering phosphate concentration. Implementation of both sorting methods and performance testing is required. 3. Searching Algorithms: Implement Binary Search and Interpolation Search algorithms to efficiently find temperature and/or phosphate values for a user-specified date. This involves searching through sorted data to locate the relevant values.
